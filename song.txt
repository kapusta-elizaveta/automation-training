Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like
getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit,
I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin',
my neck is flossin'
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Buy matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?"
I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
